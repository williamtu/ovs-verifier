# OVS BPF-verifier issue cases

This repo is intended to keep track of all the verifier issues we encountered,
as the way to finish the implementation of OVS-eBPF project.

Each case should have its own directory, ex: ovs-01, and contains source code,
BPF object file, BPF objdump file, and verifier log, the more detail the better.
